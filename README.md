# ComputerVisionProject
Using teachablemachine.withgoogle.com, we trained a machine to recognize four images: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. 
We will then use our trained model and install dependicies. 
Afterward, we will code for the game of Rock, Paper and Scissors using if/else statements
Finally, we will proceed to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the computer.
